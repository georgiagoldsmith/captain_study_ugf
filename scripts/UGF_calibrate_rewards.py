"""Example: Run Reward Calibration

Calibrates reward-term scales once, always using the *global* agent
configuration (regardless of whatever USE_REGIONAL_AGENTS/REGION_ID is
currently set in train_policy.py), and saves the result to
reward_calibration.json.

Why global-only: calibration derives per-reward-term multipliers from probe
episodes, and those multipliers depend on how many cells get protected
during the probes. If every agent mode calibrated itself independently, a
global run and a regional run would end up with different multipliers and
their reward values would not be comparable. Running calibration once here
(reusing train_policy.py's own environment-building code, forced to
USE_REGIONAL_AGENTS=False, REGION_ID=None) and having train_policy.py always
load this file keeps reward scales consistent across all modes.

Run this once before training in any mode; re-run only if the reward terms,
weights, or dataset change.
